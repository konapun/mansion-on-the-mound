# A Mystery at the Mansion on the Mound
A clone of a horror adventure board game with a similar name. This project is currently under development and completion is subject to my whims.

## Tech
In part, this project is an excuse to use:
  * [crafty](https://github.com/craftyjs/Crafty) - an easy to use component-based game framework
  * [socket.io](https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io) - realtime app framework with fallbacks; used to sync clients/server
  * [yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman) - my favorite workflow generator!
